# ðŸŽ¯ KPA API Integration: Executive Summary

## ðŸŒŸ **The Opportunity**

Your current MVN Great Save Raffle system, while functional, requires significant manual effort for each drawing. By integrating directly with your KPA software, we can transform this into a fully automated, real-time employee engagement platform.

### **What It Does:**
- **Automatic Data Retrieval**: Pull participant lists directly from KPA with smart filtering
- **Real-time Photos**: Automatically retrieve employee photos from KPA profiles  
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Filter by date range, prize level, location, and department
- **Seamless Winner Recording**: Automatically log winners back to KPA system
- **One-Click Operation**: Transform 20-minute setup into 30-second process

### **How It Works:**
```
KPA Database â†’ API Integration â†’ Raffle App â†’ Winner Selection â†’ Auto-Record to KPA
     â†‘                                                                    â†“
